# Distributed-road-network

Arduino code for a Distributed road network with purpose to inform the drivers about the road condition.

The server.ino has to be uploaded to each static ground station and the client.ino to each vehicle.
We use the Arduino uno and the RFM22 shield to communicate at the ISM band.
